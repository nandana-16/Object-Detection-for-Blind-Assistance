# Object-Detection-for-Blind-Assistance
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by using real-time object detection and text-to-speech (TTS) to announce detected objects aloud. The system uses a webcam to capture the environment, detects objects using a pre-trained YOLO model, and announces the detected objects using TTS.
